### Description

The purpose of this application is to put my React Native skills learnt in the Mobile Computing course to use in the
development of a mobile app.

In out daily lives, people routinely misplace their belongings such as cell phones, laptops, wallets, clothing,
instruments, and other objects. The purpose of this project is to establish a mobile application called <b>Lost and
Found</b> for University of Regina students and employees, where user can post about their misplaced belongings on
campus and anybody can add a note about something they find on campus. If someone finds something they own on this app,
they can claim it by validating the item's details and receiving contact information from the person who found it.

The University of Regina's students, faculty, and on-campus personnel will be the primary users of this app, who have lost or found items on the campus. This app will be user-friendly enough that any non-technical person can use it. So, anyone who has either found or has lost any precious items will need a medium or a platform where they can either search for their lost items or can report an item they found.

### Motivation
I chose this topic for this project since I recently misplaced my pricey Apple Airpods during a lecture theÂ University , and a friend misplaced his car keys on campus as well. During this time, we were unable to find our stuff since we were unsure where we had misplaced them. Furthermore, we were both new to the university and unclear of what to do due to the university's enormous campus. At the time, I had a thought about creating an application for this purpose.

## Features

- `Authentication`: This app will have a straightforward authentication mechanism for gaining access to their account.
- `Add lost/found item`: Users who have lost or found items on the university campus can report them using this app by filling out a form that includes an image, brand name, type, color, the location where the item was lost or found, and other information.
- `Search Option`: This app will have a search feature that will allow users to look for items they have lost.
- `Claim item`: By clicking on the Claim button, a user can claim an item listed on this app by filling out a form with information about the lost item, which will be compared to the claimed item. If the details match, the contact information for the person who found the item will be displayed, and the user can contact that person to get his or her item back.
